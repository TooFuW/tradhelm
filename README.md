# 🚀 [Tradhelm – CASSINI Hackathon Project](https://taikai.network/fr/cassinihackathons/hackathons/eu-space-consumer-experience/projects/cmh890hy102pcgs2wj7v9q90k/idea)

**Tradhelm** is a project developed for the **CASSINI Hackathon: *EU Space for Consumer Experience***, an innovation challenge organized by the European Union.  
The hackathon invites participants to create new consumer applications using **European space technologies** such as **Copernicus** (Earth observation) and **Galileo** (satellite navigation).  
Our project addresses **Challenge #1: “Immersive and interactive consumer applications.”**

---

## 💡 Idea

Tradhelm is a **real-time multiplayer strategy game** where players start on different continents and grow from small villages into powerful nations. Resources are distributed by biome using **Copernicus satellite data**, so no player has everything they need.  
The deeper goal is to raise awareness among young people about environmental resources and their depletion.  
Victory is tied to preservation: players can only succeed by forming alliances, **managing extraction responsibly**, and protecting their honor, earned through cooperation and lost through betrayal.  
With limited insight into others’ strategies, every decision shapes trust and survival. It’s a management game where interaction and **sustainability** determine success, designed for schools and **educational** organizations.

## 🌐 EU space technologies

Tradhelm uses **Copernicus Earth observation data** to define biomes and resource availability (agriculture, forests, water, minerals, energy).  
These **real-world datasets** make gameplay authentic and dynamic, allowing the game to closely **simulate Earth’s ecological and economic systems**.  
This realism serves both to foster **environmental awareness** and **responsibility** among players and to offer insights into collective behavioral patterns within resource management and cooperation.

## 🛰️ EU Space for Consumer Experience

The project contributes to **Challenge #1: “Immersive and interactive consumer applications”** by transforming **Copernicus data** into a realistic, global multiplayer simulation.  
It turns European space technology into an interactive experience that blends strategy, education, and **environmental responsibility**, **promoting awareness** and behavioral understanding through play.
