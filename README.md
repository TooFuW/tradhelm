# 🚀 Tradhelm – CASSINI Hackathon Project

**Tradhelm** is a project developed for the **CASSINI Hackathon: *EU Space for Consumer Experience***, an innovation challenge organized by the European Union.  
The hackathon invites participants to create new consumer applications using **European space technologies** such as **Copernicus** (Earth observation) and **Galileo** (satellite navigation).  
Our project falls under the **“Immersive and interactive consumer applications”** challenge.

## 🌍 What is Tradhelm?

**Tradhelm** is a **real-time multiplayer web strategy game** where players start from small villages on different continents and evolve into powerful nations.  
Each region’s resources are based on **real Copernicus satellite data**, which defines biomes and available natural resources such as water, forests, agriculture, minerals, and energy.  

No player has access to all resources, forcing **trade, negotiation, and alliances**—or **espionage and sabotage**.  
Players earn and lose **honor points** based on their actions, shaping a dynamic world of cooperation and deceit.  
At the end of the match, the player with the most honor points wins.

## 🛰️ How EU Space Technologies Are Used

- **Copernicus** provides Earth observation data to generate realistic biomes and resource distributions.  
- These datasets make the world dynamic and authentic, connecting virtual strategy to real environmental information.  

This approach turns **European space data** into an **interactive global simulation**, blending **gameplay, education, and environmental awareness**.

## 🎮 Why It Fits the CASSINI Hackathon

Tradhelm transforms real-world space data into an engaging experience that helps players understand **resource interdependence, sustainability, and geopolitics** through play.  
It demonstrates how **EU space technologies** can enhance **interactive consumer applications** while promoting environmental insight and strategic thinking.
