# 💎 **Idea**

**Tradhelm** is a **real-time multiplayer strategy game** where players start on different continents and grow from small villages into powerful nations. **Resources are distributed by biome using Copernicus satellite data**, so no player has everything they need. The deeper goal is to **raise awareness among young people about environmental resources and their depletion**. **Victory is tied to preservation**: players can only succeed by forming alliances, managing extraction responsibly, and protecting their **honor**, earned through cooperation and lost through betrayal. With limited insight into others’ strategies, every decision shapes trust and survival. It’s a **management game where interaction and sustainability determine success**, designed for **schools and educational organizations**.

# 🛰️ **EU Space Technologies**

Tradhelm uses **Copernicus Earth observation data** to define **biomes and resource availability** (agriculture, forests, water, minerals, energy). These **real-world datasets** make gameplay **authentic and dynamic**, allowing the game to **closely simulate Earth’s ecological and economic systems**. This realism serves both to **foster environmental awareness and responsibility** among players and to offer **insights into collective behavioral patterns** within resource management and cooperation.

# 🌍 **EU Space for Consumer Experience**

The project contributes to **Challenge #1: “Immersive and interactive consumer applications”** by transforming **Copernicus data** into a **realistic, global multiplayer simulation**. It turns **European space technology** into an **interactive experience** that blends **strategy, education, and environmental responsibility**, promoting **awareness and behavioral understanding through play**.
