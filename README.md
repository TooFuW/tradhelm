# 🚀 Tradhelm – CASSINI Hackathon Project

**Tradhelm** is a project developed for the **CASSINI Hackathon: *EU Space for Consumer Experience***, an innovation challenge organized by the European Union.  
The hackathon invites participants to create new consumer applications using **European space technologies** such as **Copernicus** (Earth observation) and **Galileo** (satellite navigation).  
Our project addresses **Challenge #1: “Immersive and interactive consumer applications.”**

## 🌍 What is Tradhelm?

**Tradhelm** is a **real-time multiplayer web strategy game** where players start from small villages on different continents and grow into powerful nations.  
Each region’s resources are determined by **real Copernicus satellite data**, defining biomes and the availability of **water, forests, agriculture, minerals, and energy**.  

No player possesses all resources, making **trade, negotiation, and cooperation** essential—or **espionage and betrayal** for the bold.  
Players earn and lose **honor points** based on their actions, shaping a living world where **trust, strategy, and responsibility** coexist.  
The player with the highest honor at the end wins.

Tradhelm’s purpose is to **raise environmental awareness** and **teach sustainable management** through gameplay, targeting **educational institutions (B2B)** as a tool for engaging students in global resource challenges.

## 🛰️ How EU Space Technologies Are Used

- **Copernicus** provides Earth observation data to generate realistic biomes and resource distributions.  
- These datasets make gameplay authentic and dynamic, closely simulating Earth’s ecosystems.  
- This realism serves to **foster environmental responsibility** and also enables **behavioral analysis** of cooperation and competition patterns among players.

By transforming **Copernicus data** into an **interactive simulation**, Tradhelm merges **strategy, education, and sustainability** into one experience.
